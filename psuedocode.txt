 project is to create a web app to a collection of cooking recipes.

The project must use the following technologies:
- Python Flask server to generate the html pages for the project.
- Jinja2 templates to re-use html
- Appropriate form validation
- CSS for html styles
- CSV files to store recipe information
- Search functionality - Pandas to read in the information from CSV into
    dataframes along with suitable filter operations
- Git and GitHub for version control

For a higher grade, you should implement the following as well: (please see rubric for more details)
